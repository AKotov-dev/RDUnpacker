# RDUnpacker - RPM and DEB package Unpacker

It has become a common occurrence that it is impossible to unpack/view the contents of `RPM` and `DEB` packages in various Linux distributions. This applies to the usual full-time archiver and to Midnight Commander in particular. As practice has shown, unpacking of these formats is performed in different systems in different ways. To somehow solve this problem, `RDUnpacker` was made. It can be useful for maintainers and ordinary users to explore the content that is installed in the system.
